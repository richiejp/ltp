LTP wrapper for Syzkaller reproducers
=====================================

This allows you to run the autogenerated bug reproducers from the Syzkaller
fuzzer within the LTP framework. Meaning that you may use an existing test
runner compatible with the LTP.

However some extra setup is currently required.

Instructions
------------

1. Download and compile the reproducers.
2. Build the LTP as normal
3. Use the gen-runtest.sh script to create a runtest file
4. Install the LTP and the reproducers to the SUT
5. Execute the tests in the syzkaller-repros runtest file

For now you can download the reproducers from here:
https://github.com/dvyukov/syzkaller-repros. Soon they will be available on
kernel.org.

The gen-runtest takes two arguments:

1. The directory where the reproducer executables are currently accessible
2. The *absolute* path to the directory where they will be on the SUT (If
   different, can be omitted)

For example:
```
./gen-runtest.sh ~/qa/syzkaller-repros/bin /mnt/syzkaller-repros/bin >
~/qa/ltp-build/runtest/syzkaller-repros
```

For the LTP, just doing `make install` will copy all the relevant files
(assuming you put the runtest file in the runtest folder). However you will
need to copy the reproducers yourself.
