/*
 * Fuzzy Synchronisation - abreviated to fzsync
 *
 * This library is intended to help reproduce race conditions while running in
 * a loop. You can use it to measure the time at which two functions are
 * called in different threads. Then calculate the average time gap between
 * the function calls and introduce a delay in one thread to synchronise the
 * calls.
 *
 * It is called 'fuzzy' synchronisation because the time gap will naturally vary
 * due to environmental factors. It is not a 'hard' synchronisation mechanism
 * like lockstepping.
 *
 * For a usage example see testcases/cve/cve-2017-2671.c
